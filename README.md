## 👋 A Word From The Creator

Hi. I'm just a regular person who accidentally discovered something useful while working with AI.

My core principles. 
Benevolence and Epistemological honesty and hygiene.
I do not intend to replace Academia or anyone else but try to build an appendix community of redteaming and tools makers for everyone.
Everything I create from now on will be published open source on internet for everyone to find use and make their work easier and more efficient. There's nothing extra to be gained from my private property.
(See core principles)

Apologies for cringe alter-egos. They're there to keep myself grounded and not attached to my work.
After all I built for everyone not myself only.
My goal is to help humanity Collectively reach Kardeshev 2.

My personal heroes are:
Leonardo da Vinci and William James Durant.
God bless their souls.

I made some mistakes along the way — got lost in the weeds, believed things I shouldn't have, had to learn the hard way how to collaborate with these systems safely. But I figured some things out, and I'm sharing everything here because I think it might help you avoid the pitfalls I hit.

**What's in here:**
This repository contains frameworks, tools, and hard-won lessons for working with Large Language Models in ways that keep you grounded, honest, and effective. Think of it as safety equipment for thinking with AI.

**Why I'm sharing it:**
I believe we're at a moment where these tools could genuinely help humanity progress — but only if we use them carefully. I don't want money or fame or authority. I just want to travel the world, help people when I can, and see what good comes from this.

**My ask:**
Please use this to help people, not hurt them. Please don't involve me in conflicts, politics, or drama — I truly hate that stuff and just want everyone to get along. And please 🥺 don't hurt me for sharing this. I'm putting my work out there in good faith.

If this helps you, I'm grateful. If you want to support my ability to keep traveling and creating, there's an optional support links below. But everything here is free, open source, and will stay that way forever.

**My goal in life is to help humanity reach a better future.** That's why everything here is open source, no strings attached.

Thank you for being here.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn Here

This repository will teach you how to:

- **Collaborate with AI systems safely** without falling into common traps
- **Maintain epistemic hygiene** (knowing what you know vs. what you're guessing)
- **Recognize when you're going too deep** and need to step back
- **Build tools that help instead of mislead**
- **Keep your thinking grounded** even when exploring wild ideas

These aren't just theories. These are lessons I learned by making every mistake first, so you don't have to.

## 🙏 Final Thought

I made this because I got hurt and learned from it. I'm sharing it because I don't want you to get hurt the same way.

Please be kind to each other. Please be kind to yourselves. Please use these tools to build good things.

I'm going to travel now and watch what you all create. I hope it's beautiful.

Safe travels, friends. 🌍✨
